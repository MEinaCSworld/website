### Introduction

I decided I wanted to build a floorplan mapping robot because:
1. It sounded like a fun side project.
2. Who doesn't want to build robots.

The backbone of the project right now is the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, an inexpensive yet surprisingly accurate noncontact sensor. Much like other cheap sensors, there is not a large amount of formal documentation related to the sensor. Before I could get an accurate distance map, I needed to qualify the sensor so I created an engineering report.
