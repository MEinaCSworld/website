Mechanical engineering background - Focused on customer driven product development.


My professional interests include product development, healthcare system improvement, and smart decision making in uncertain situations. I love to speak with customers and stakeholders about how to make things better.

To attack these problems, I employ a mixture of data visualization, process improvement strategies, and deep literature searches. Usually, I use Python with matplotlib or charting the process to illuminate the path for solving the problem at hand.
